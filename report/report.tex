\begin{abstract}
  One of the issues faced by the maintainers of popular open source software is the triage 
  of new reported issues. Many of the issues submitted toXX the Issues Tracker are questions.
  SomeXX people ask questions onXX Issues Trackers aboutXX their problem instead of using a QA 
  website like StackOverflow. This may seem insignificant but for many of the big projects 
  with millions of users this leads spamming of the Issue Tracking. Reading and labelling
  these unrelated issues manually is a serious time consuming task and these unrelated questions 
  and to the burden. In fact, most often maintainers demand to not submit questions in the 
  Issue Tracker.

  To address this problem, first we have implemented a pattern based method
  to clean issue texts and remove noise like log lines, stack traces, environment variables, code snippets, etc.
  Second, we have implemented a classification-based approach to automatically label unrelated questions. 
  Empirical evaluations on a dataset of 100k records show that our approach 
  can detect questions with an accuracy of 80\%.

\section{Introduction}
With the prevalence of successfully open source software, authors of projects kindly carry on 
the responsibility of supporting users and providing documentation for their users. The relation 
between users and authors is a two-way relation, developers rely on feedback and reports from 
users to improve their software. These feedbacks come in the form of bug reports, questions, 
features, suggestions, and enhancements, or what we technically call "Issue"s. Most developers
prefer to use the Issue Tracking software just as a mean for developing the software, it is preferred 
that questions related to the workings or documentation of the software be directed to forums or QA
websites. And by questions we mean everything that is, asking about how to fix an error/problem, 
asking about features and documentation, asking for help, etc.

These unrelated questions only add to the clutter of Issues Trackers, especially in bigger projects,
developers have to put serious amount of effort to triage or close issues. Providing a 
simple automated tool to detect potential unrelated questions can help project managers 
and software developers to focus on more practical issues.

XXX Other works of software defect classification focus on classifying bugs, 
features, enhancements, etc and they don't include questions. Because most of them are 
based on the data provided from XXX internal Issue Trackers of projects like Mozilla, jBoss, and etc, 
almost they don't contain questions. But for maintainers that use the build-in Issue Tracker
of websites like GitHub the problem still remains. In addition, we want to focus on implementing 
a binary classifier to filter questions, instead of the multi-class classifier that other 
works propose. Maybe we can say that the goals are a little different or even complementary. 
For example, we can first filter spams by using our proposed classifier and then when 
we are more confident that the reported issue is XXX good, we can use another classifier to 
automatically categorize it. This may improve the accuracy of automatic categorization, and 
enables deployment of these classifiers on a broader range of projects.

In This work we want to investigate the feasibility of detecting unrelated and XXX bothersome questions
in issue tracker of popular open source software on platforms like GitHub. We want to evaluate the performance
of different classification algorithms. And finally, to compare the performance of a binary classification 
(question, not-question) approach to other multi-class methods used in other works.

As mentioned earlier, our goal is to train a binary classifier to automatically label questions.
We have used previously available dataset of GitHub issues provided by \cite{8816794}.
Cleaning and pre-processing the dataset narrowed down the count of our available 
records to 102,198. The pre-processing part was the hardest part of our implementation
since text of issues usually contain machine generated text data like logs. 
After extracting text part of issues we have used state of the art sentence embedding techniques
to convert text data to numerical features. After evaluating several classification 
algorithms, We achieved the best result with the XXX SVM classification algorithm. 
In summary, our approach involves three main phases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1)] The first phase is cleaning and pre-processing the text data of issues. 
  We used around 400 regular expressions to remove noise from the text of issues. 
  Most of the issues are not properly formatted and they contain stack traces, log lines, code snippets, 
  command lines, environment variables, configurations, ip addresses, identifiers, flags, timestamps, etc.
  We have also applied the standard NLP pre-processing tasks such as removing punctuations 
  and tokenization to prepare texts for the classifiers.
  \item[2)] The second phase is computing a sentence embedding of each text document provided by 
  the previous step. We have used the Sentence Bert \cite{reimers-2019-sentence-bert} technique to convert our
  documents to a high dimensional vector representation. The Sentence Bert is one the 
  best performing sentence embedding techniques according to benchmarks \cite{reimers-2019-sentence-bert}.
  \item[3)] The final phase is training a classifier on extracted features. We have evaluated
  the performance of SVM, NaiveBayes, Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest and LMT Tree 
  classification algorithms.
\end{itemize}
In Section \ref{approach} we describe our dataset, data pre-precessing methods, 
and the technical implementation. In Section \ref{eval} we show the performance of our implementation
and discuss the results. In Section \ref{relworks} we discuss other related works.
The Section \ref{conclusion} concludes this report.

\section{Approach}\label{approach}
approach

\subsection{Dataset}
We used the RapidRelease \cite{8816794} dataset. It contains 2 million issues from active and popular 
GitHub repositories of 18 programming languages. The provided dataset is in the format of a SQL database.
The label of each issue, applied by the maintainer, is also available. With a simple query we extracted
top applied labels on issues, you can see the count of the top 20 labels in XX Table 1. We selected these
top labels, bug, duplicate, enhancement, feature, improvement, and question to find more labels based on them.
For example some projects may use the label "type: bug" to represent a bug. Also, many  of the issues 
have more than one label. The labels are stored as string in a comma separated format. For example, an
issue with both labels of bug and duplicate, is stored as "bug, duplicate". We can now easily query 
issues that contain, for example, the string "feature" in their labels. 
We queried the count of labels that contained them in their string 
and sorted them by their usage count. For example, The top five applied labels that contained the "bug" string 
are XX "Y yy y". A label with a higher usage count gives more confidence that it was applied correctly
for its intended purpose and that the label is not arbitrary. 
Therefore we have only selected labels from these list that had at least were used XX 50 times.   

User like filter to get some non question issues [bug, duplicate, enhancement, feature, wontfix, improvement ]. Filtered out issues that had question tag too.
Used like filter for “question”
For each tag I have selecect top tag. After counting and sorting them we selected tags which appeared more than 50 times. 
Excluded help wanted, because some users used this label incorrectly to ask for help. But it is for the author to ask for other people to contribute.
For questions only choosed closed issues.
Removes bug, discussion tags from question.

\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline

\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.

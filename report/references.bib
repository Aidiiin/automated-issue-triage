  abstract = {Bug tracking systems are valuable assets for managing maintenance activities. They are widely used in open-source projects as well as in the software industry. They collect many different kinds of issues: requests for defect fixing, enhancements, refactoring/restructuring activities and organizational issues. These different kinds of issues are simply labeled as "bug" for lack of a better classification support or of knowledge about the possible kinds.This paper investigates whether the text of the issues posted in bug tracking systems is enough to classify them into corrective maintenance and other kinds of activities.We show that alternating decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers, and logistic regression can be used to accurately distinguish bugs from other kinds of issues. Results from empirical studies performed on issues for Mozilla, Eclipse, and JBoss indicate that issues can be classified with between 77% and 82% of correct decisions.},

  abstract = {More than twelve years have elapsed since the first public release of WEKA. In that time, the software has been rewritten entirely from scratch, evolved substantially and now accompanies a text on data mining [35]. These days, WEKA enjoys widespread acceptance in both academia and business, has an active community, and has been downloaded more than 1.4 million times since being placed on Source-Forge in April 2000. This paper provides an introduction to the WEKA workbench, reviews the history of the project, and, in light of the recent 3.6 stable release, briefly discusses what has been added since the last stable version (Weka 3.4) released in 2003.},

  abstract = {Studies have found that significant amount of bug reports are misclassified between bugs and non-bugs, which inevitably affects relevant studies, e.g., bug prediction. Manually classifying bug reports helps reduce the noise but is often time-consuming. To ease the problem, we propose a bug classification method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a typical recurrent neural network which is widely used in text classification tasks. Our method outperforms existing topic-based method and n-gram IDF-based method on four datasets from three popular JAVA open source projects. We believe our work can assist developers and researches to classify bug reports and identify misclassified bug reports. Datasets and scripts used in this work are provided on GitHub1 for others to reproduce and further improve our study.},
